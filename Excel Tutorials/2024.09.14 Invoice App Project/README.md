## Introduction

This Excel invoice application is designed to automate the process of generating invoices by calculating totals, discounts, and providing a printable format. It incorporates various Excel functions, such as cell merging, conditional formatting, and formula applications, to streamline invoice creation.

## Setting Up the Invoice

### Designing the Layout

In this chapter, we set up the structure of the invoice, including headers for product details, quantity, price, discount, and total.

1. **Headers:** Use cell formatting to create the titles of columns like "Product Name", "Quantity", "Unit Price", "Discount", and "Total Price".
2. **Borders:** Ensure the table looks professional by adding borders to all cells that will hold data.

### Formatting the Cells

Use **Merge Cells** and formatting techniques to create special sections for:
- **Invoice Title**
- **Date**
- **Invoice Number**
- **Customer Information**
- **Special Notes** (at the bottom of the invoice for additional instructions).

## Formulas Used

### Total Calculation

To calculate the total cost of each product, we used the formula:

```excel
=Quantity * Unit Price
```

Where:
- `Quantity`: The number of items ordered.
- `Unit Price`: The price per item.

For example, in cell `F5`, the formula for the total might be:

```excel
= D5 * E5
```

### Discount Application

To apply a discount on the total price, the formula is:

```excel
= IF(Discount > 0, Total * (1 - Discount), Total)
```

This formula calculates the discounted total by reducing the price based on the discount percentage. If no discount is given, the total remains unchanged. For example, in `G5`, the formula could look like:

```excel
= IF(F5>0, F5 * (1 - H5), F5)
```

Where:
- `F5`: The calculated total before discount.
- `H5`: The discount percentage (e.g., 5% would be `0.05`).

### Conditional Formatting for Discounts

To ensure that no discount information appears if the discount is 0%, a conditional formatting rule is applied.

Steps:
1. Select the Discount cell.
2. Go to **Conditional Formatting** > **New Rule**.
3. Use the formula:
   ```excel
   = H5 <= 0
   ```
4. Set the font color to white (so it is invisible on a white background when thereâ€™s no discount).

## Special Notes and Instructions

At the bottom of the invoice, there is a **Special Notes and Instructions** section. This allows the user to input any additional information relevant to the customer.

Steps:
1. Merge the required cells across the bottom of the invoice.
2. Add a title such as "Special Notes and Instructions."
3. Apply formatting, such as borders and background color, to distinguish this section.

```excel
= "Make all checks payable to [Your Company Name]"
```

## Handling Page Breaks and Printing

To ensure the invoice prints on a single page:

1. **Page Break Preview:** Go to **View** > **Page Break Preview** to adjust where Excel will break the page.
2. **Adjust Columns:** Drag the boundaries to fit everything on one page if necessary.
3. **Print Area:** Select the cells to include in the printed version and set the **Print Area**.

Finally, you can export the invoice as a **PDF**:
- Press **Ctrl+P** to access the print menu.
- Choose **Microsoft Print to PDF** and save the file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to create a structured and automated invoice application using Excel. The flexibility of Excel formulas, cell formatting, and print controls allows users to customize this application according to their specific needs.
